projet final web III game_type: hearthstone


This is a web game created for my web class, the theme that i chose for this game is Pok√©mon. It serves as a demonstration of my skills and growth as the final project for web III. The game is built with a PHP backend and a Javascript frontend. It utilizes ajax to interact with the database and handle data.


## Usage

The first thing to do is to log into your account. Once you have an account you can create a deck with the teacher's api. You can then play against the AI or another player. You can also see your stats liste= your most played card in the stats and deck tab.In this tab, you can also change your deck or see the stats of other players .

When you're logged you enter the lobby where you can go into a game against an other player or AI. You can see the chat on the right and the list of players on the left, go to the stats/deck tab , chose a hero on the bottom tu use in game or quit the application.

![InGame][game]
In game, turn by turn you can chose to place a card on the board or attack a card on the board. You can also use your hero power if you have enough mana.  You can see the cards in your hand on the bottom and the cards on the board in the middle. There is a toggle for the hero powers with a legend of their effects depending on the hero class. There is another toggle to see the chat in game. Every card you can play in your hand will be higher than the rest of the cards. You can see the stats of all the players and a countdown of every turn.
